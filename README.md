## Revealing Module Pattern
First I used the Module Pattern because I wanted to try one of the most common design patterns. Then I changed to Revealing Module Pattern. Both of them are nice design patterns in general and structure the code nicely. It is easier to declare functions in Revealing Module Pattern, compared to Module Pattern where you must write functions in object literal notation. A con with the Revealing Module Pattern may be that it's not possible to override functions since you return references to functions (compared to Module pattern where you return the actual function). But I really like that you get the clear view at the end of the module of what is accessable and have the possibility to change the name of these public functions.

## Tools
In this project I've used Sass, ES6 (compiled with Babel), Bootstrap and jQuery Bar Rating.
