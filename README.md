# Design Pattern Assignment - Movie Database

Module Pattern was chosen because I wanted to try one of the most common design patterns and I donâ€™t mind writing functions in object literal notation. It is a nice design pattern in general and structure the code nicely. It's possible to override functions (compared to Revealing Module pattern where you return references to functions). Some cons with this pattern: the object literal notation may be annoying and it lacks the clear view at the end of the module of what is accessable.
